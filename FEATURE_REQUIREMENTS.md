## üìù Feature 1: Adjustable Names Management

### User Story
As a user, I want to be able to add, remove, and edit names in the picker so that I can customize the list for different groups or occasions.

### Functional Requirements

#### 1.1 Add New Names
- **Requirement**: User can add new names to the current list
- **Interface**: Text input field with "Add Name" button
- **Validation**: 
  - Name must not be empty or only whitespace
  - Name should not already exist in the list (case-insensitive)
  - Maximum name length: 50 characters
- **Behavior**: New name appears immediately in the name list display

#### 1.2 Remove Existing Names
- **Requirement**: User can remove names from the current list
- **Interface**: Delete button (‚ùå) next to each name chip
- **Validation**: 
  - Must have at least 1 name remaining in the list
  - Confirm deletion for safety
- **Behavior**: Name is removed immediately from display and picker pool

#### 1.3 Edit Existing Names
- **Requirement**: User can modify existing names
- **Interface**: Click-to-edit functionality on name chips
- **Validation**: Same validation rules as adding new names
- **Behavior**: Name updates immediately in display and picker pool

#### 1.4 Name List Management
- **Requirement**: Clear visual display of all current names
- **Interface**: Enhanced name chips with management controls
- **Behavior**: Names remain in memory during session

### Technical Requirements
- Maintain current `names` array structure
- Update picker logic to use current names list
- Preserve existing name display functionality
- Ensure responsive design on all devices

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can add new names via input field
- [ ] User can delete individual names (with confirmation)
- [ ] User can edit names by clicking on them
- [ ] Name list updates immediately reflect in picker functionality
- [ ] Validation prevents duplicate, empty, or overly long names

## üîÑ Feature 2: No-Repeat Toggle

### User Story
As a user, I want to toggle whether picked names can be selected again so that I can ensure everyone gets a turn before anyone goes twice.

### Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 Toggle Control
- **Requirement**: Simple toggle switch to enable/disable no-repeat mode
- **Interface**: Toggle switch with clear labels ("Allow Repeats" vs "No Repeats")
- **Default State**: Disabled (current behavior - allows repeats)
- **Behavior**: Toggle state persists during session

#### 2.2 No-Repeat Mode Behavior
- **Requirement**: When enabled, picked names are removed from selection pool
- **Interface**: Visual indication of used vs available names
- **Behavior**: 
  - Picked names become "grayed out" or marked as "used"
  - Picker only selects from remaining available names
  - Once all names are used, automatic reset or manual reset option

#### 2.3 Reset Functionality
- **Requirement**: Way to restore all names to available pool
- **Interface**: "Reset All Names" button (visible when no-repeat is enabled)
- **Behavior**: 
  - All names become available again
  - Visual indicators reset
  - Confirmation prompt before resetting

#### 2.4 Visual Feedback
- **Requirement**: Clear indication of name status (available vs used)
- **Interface**: 
  - Available names: Normal appearance
  - Used names: Grayed out, crossed out, or marked with ‚úì
  - Count display: "X of Y names remaining"
- **Behavior**: Updates immediately when names are picked

### Technical Requirements
- Add toggle state management
- Implement available names tracking separate from master list
- Update picker logic to only select from available names
- Maintain current animation and UI behavior
- Handle edge cases (all names used, single name remaining)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Toggle switch clearly labeled and functional
- [ ] When enabled, picked names are removed from selection pool
- [ ] Visual distinction between available and used names
- [ ] Count display shows remaining available names
- [ ] Reset button restores all names to available pool
- [ ] Graceful handling when all names are exhausted
- [ ] Toggle state works with name management feature
- [ ] Smooth integration with existing animations and UI

## üé® UI/UX Considerations

### Design Principles
- **Consistency**: Match existing modern, playful design aesthetic
- **Accessibility**: Clear labels, good contrast, keyboard navigation
- **Responsiveness**: All features work on mobile devices
- **Intuitive**: Self-explanatory interface requiring minimal learning

### Integration Points
- Name management should integrate seamlessly with existing name display
- No-repeat toggle should be prominently visible but not intrusive
- Both features should work together harmoniously
- Maintain existing keyboard shortcuts and interactions

### Visual Enhancements
- Smooth transitions for all state changes
- Consistent with existing sparkle/animation theme
- Clear visual hierarchy between different UI elements
- Maintain current color scheme and typography
